    "atp_description": "The Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) Coprocessor provides a foundation of rigorous logical verification. It constructs and validates formal proofs, ensuring high-level reasoning is grounded in axiomatic truth.",
    "eris_description": "The Eris Engine introduces stochastic perturbations (controlled chaos) into the cognitive state. This prevents convergence on local optima, stimulating lateral thinking and creative divergence.",
    "lagrange_description": "The Lagrange Engine applies the Principle of Least Action to cognitive trajectories. It simulates the evolution of ideas as physical systems, seeking optimal paths through the conceptual landscape.",
